## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the TeachAssist data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed', e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components, as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain and they should make sense on their own without depending on other components.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Unlike the original AB3 model, TeachAssist uses student-specific fields and records instead of tag-based contact classification. Each `Person` stores student-related fields such as `Name`, `CourseId`, `Email`, `StudentId`, `TGroup`, `Tele`, `WeekList`, `Progress`, and a list of `Remark` objects.

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TeachAssist data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Key Feature Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Feature: Add Student

#### Overview

Describe the purpose of the `add` command and how it differs from the original AB3 implementation. State that TeachAssist uses student-specific fields instead of generic contact-oriented fields.

#### Student data model

Describe the student-related field classes involved in creating a student record, such as `Name`, `StudentId`, `CourseId`, `TGroup`, `Email`, `Tele`, and any other relevant attributes stored in `Person`.

Relevant diagram: Class diagram showing `Person` and the student-related field classes.

#### Implementation

Explain how `AddCommandParser` parses the user input, validates each field, constructs the `Person` object, and passes it to `AddCommand` for insertion into the model.

#### Duplicate handling

Explain how TeachAssist checks whether a student record already exists before adding it, and describe which fields are used to determine duplicates in the current implementation.

### Feature: Delete Student

#### Overview

Describe the purpose of the `delete` command and explain that it has been extended beyond the original AB3 version.

#### Supported delete modes

Explain that TeachAssist supports deletion by displayed index and by student details. State the exact student details required for detail-based deletion.

#### Confirmation workflow

Explain that deletion does not happen immediately after a valid delete command. Describe how TeachAssist first identifies the target student, prompts the user for confirmation, and then proceeds only if the user confirms.

Relevant diagram: Activity diagram showing the branching delete flow, including deletion by index, deletion by student details, and confirmation handling.

#### Implementation

Explain how the parser distinguishes between the supported delete formats, what validation is performed in the parser, what validation is deferred to command execution, and how the final deletion is carried out after confirmation.

Relevant diagram: Sequence diagram showing the successful delete flow through parser, command, model, and confirmation logic.

### Feature: Update Progress

#### Overview

Describe the purpose of the `updateprogress` command and how it helps TAs track a student’s academic standing or follow-up status.

#### Progress representation

Explain the valid progress states supported by TeachAssist and describe how the progress status is represented in the model.

#### Implementation

Explain how the command identifies the target student, validates the new progress value, updates the relevant `Person` object, and replaces the old record in the model.

Relevant diagram: Sequence diagram showing how the command identifies the student, validates the progress status, and updates the model.

#### UI integration

Describe how progress is displayed in the UI.

### Feature: Mark Attendance

#### Overview

Describe the purpose of the `markattendance` command and how it supports tutorial or class attendance tracking in TeachAssist.

#### Attendance representation

Explain how attendance information is represented in the model. State whether attendance is stored as a count, a list, a status field, or another structure.

#### Implementation

Explain how the command parses the attendance input, identifies the target student, validates the attendance-related value, updates the student record, and commits the updated record back into the model.

Relevant diagram: Sequence diagram showing how attendance input is parsed, validated, and recorded for the target student.

### Feature: Remark Command

#### Overview

Describe the purpose of the `remark` command and how it allows TAs to store comment-like notes on individual students.

#### Remark representation

Explain how remarks are represented in the model, such as whether each remark is stored as text alone or as a richer object containing metadata like date or timestamp.

Relevant diagram: Class diagram snippet showing how remarks are associated with a student record.

#### Implementation

Explain how the `remark` command parses the target student and remark text, constructs the new remark, adds it to the student record, and updates the modified student in the model.

Relevant diagram: Sequence diagram showing how the remark is parsed, created, and attached to the target student.

### Feature: View Command

#### Overview

Describe the purpose of the `view` command and what additional student information it allows users to inspect.

#### UI behaviour

Explain what the user sees when the command is executed, such as whether a separate window, popup, or detailed panel is shown, and what information is included in the display.

#### Implementation

Explain how the command identifies the target student, retrieves the required details and remarks from the model, and passes the data to the relevant UI component for display.

Relevant diagram: Sequence diagram showing how the selected student’s details and remarks are retrieved and passed to the UI for display.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1.Relax student name and find command keywords validation to support special characters. Currently, the name field accepts only alphanumeric characters and spaces; we plan to extend this to support names containing hyphens, apostrophes, and other common punctuation, such as “O’Connor” and “Smith-Jones.”

2.Extend find to support prefix-based search across additional fields such as student ID, email, and course, instead of names only.

3.Add support for multi-value filtering. Currently, each filter prefix accepts only a single value; we plan to extend this to allow multiple values under the same prefix in a single filter command.

4.Add support for more flexible absence filtering. Currently, absence filtering only supports values greater than or equal to a given threshold; we plan to extend this to support exact values, upper bounds, and ranges.
