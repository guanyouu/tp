# TeachAssist User Guide

TeachAssist is a desktop app designed to help full-time teaching assistants manage student records efficiently. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still offering the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). For teaching assistants who are comfortable typing, TeachAssist makes common administrative tasks such as adding, finding, filtering, and deleting student records faster and more convenient than traditional point-and-click apps.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to enter parameters in a fixed order?**
No. For commands with prefixes such as add and filter, parameters can be entered in any order as long as all required fields are provided.

**Q: Why did delete 1 remove a different student than I expected?**
Because the index refers to the current displayed list. You may be referring to an outdated list.
