## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the TeachAssist data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed', e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components, as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain and they should make sense on their own without depending on other components.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Unlike the original AB3 model, TeachAssist uses student-specific fields and records instead of tag-based contact classification. Each `Person` stores student-related fields such as `Name`, `CourseId`, `Email`, `StudentId`, `TGroup`, `Tele`, `WeekList`, `Progress`, and a list of `Remark` objects.

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TeachAssist data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* exposes functionality through the `Storage` interface, which extends both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* delegates JSON conversion of TeachAssist data to classes such as `JsonSerializableAddressBook`, `JsonAdaptedPerson`, and `JsonAdaptedRemark`.
* uses concrete storage classes `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonUserPrefsStorage`, which handle reading from and writing to files on disk.
* is implemented primarily by `StorageManager`, which coordinates `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonUserPrefsStorage` to provide a unified persistence interface.

TeachAssist data stored by the `Storage` component includes not only persons, but also additional persisted fields such as cancelled weeks, weekly attendance data, progress, and remarks.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Key Feature Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Feature: Add Student

#### Overview

Describe the purpose of the `add` command and how it differs from the original AB3 implementation. State that TeachAssist uses student-specific fields instead of generic contact-oriented fields.

#### Student data model

Describe the student-related field classes involved in creating a student record, such as `Name`, `StudentId`, `CourseId`, `TGroup`, `Email`, `Tele`, and any other relevant attributes stored in `Person`.

Relevant diagram: Class diagram showing `Person` and the student-related field classes.

#### Implementation

Explain how `AddCommandParser` parses the user input, validates each field, constructs the `Person` object, and passes it to `AddCommand` for insertion into the model.

#### Duplicate handling

Explain how TeachAssist checks whether a student record already exists before adding it, and describe which fields are used to determine duplicates in the current implementation.

### Feature: Delete Student

#### Overview

Describe the purpose of the `delete` command and explain that it has been extended beyond the original AB3 version.

#### Supported delete modes

Explain that TeachAssist supports deletion by displayed index and by student details. State the exact student details required for detail-based deletion.

#### Confirmation workflow

Explain that deletion does not happen immediately after a valid delete command. Describe how TeachAssist first identifies the target student, prompts the user for confirmation, and then proceeds only if the user confirms.

Relevant diagram: Activity diagram showing the branching delete flow, including deletion by index, deletion by student details, and confirmation handling.

#### Implementation

Explain how the parser distinguishes between the supported delete formats, what validation is performed in the parser, what validation is deferred to command execution, and how the final deletion is carried out after confirmation.

Relevant diagram: Sequence diagram showing the successful delete flow through parser, command, model, and confirmation logic.

### Feature: Update Progress

#### Overview

Describe the purpose of the `updateprogress` command and how it helps TAs track a student’s academic standing or follow-up status.

#### Progress representation

Explain the valid progress states supported by TeachAssist and describe how the progress status is represented in the model.

#### Implementation

Explain how the command identifies the target student, validates the new progress value, updates the relevant `Person` object, and replaces the old record in the model.

Relevant diagram: Sequence diagram showing how the command identifies the student, validates the progress status, and updates the model.

#### UI integration

Describe how progress is displayed in the UI.

### Feature: Mark Attendance

#### Overview

Describe the purpose of the `markattendance` command and how it supports tutorial or class attendance tracking in TeachAssist.

#### Attendance representation

Explain how attendance information is represented in the model. State whether attendance is stored as a count, a list, a status field, or another structure.

#### Implementation

Explain how the command parses the attendance input, identifies the target student, validates the attendance-related value, updates the student record, and commits the updated record back into the model.

Relevant diagram: Sequence diagram showing how attendance input is parsed, validated, and recorded for the target student.

### Feature: Remark Command

#### Overview

The `remark` command allows a teaching assistant to attach a short note to a specific student. This is useful for recording contextual observations that are not captured by the standard student fields (e.g class participation, submission behaviour, consultation follow-ups, or other teaching-related comments)

The command targets a student by their displayed student index in the current person list and adds a remark to that student. The remark is intended to help TAs keep track of student-specific context across multiple interactions. The command word is `remark`, and its expected format is:

`remark INDEX txt/REMARK`

For example, `remark 1 txt/Participates actively in class` adds a new remark `Participates actively in class` to the first student in the displayed list.

#### Remark representation

In the model, a remark is represented as a dedicated `Remark` object rather than plain text alone. Each remark stores:
- the remark text
- the date on which the remark was created

This design allows each remark to carry basic metadata in addition to its content. In the current implementation, the creation date is automatically assigned using `LocalDate.now()` when the command is parsed. This means the user only provides the text of the remark, while the system records the date implicitly.

- Remarks are associated with a `Person` as a list of remark objects. 
- In storage, `JsonAdaptedPerson` stores `remarks` as a `List<JsonAdaptedRemark>`.
- Each `JsonAdaptedRemark` contains a `text` field and a `date` field.
- During deserialization, each adapted remark is converted back into a model-level `Remark` object and reattached to the corresponding person.

#### Implementation

The `remark` feature is implemented using the `RemarkCommand` and `RemarkCommandParser` classes. The parser is responsible for extracting the target student index and the remark text from user input. It tokenizes the input using the `txt/` prefix, validates that both the preamble and the remark body are present, parses the preamble as an `Index`, trims the remark text, and constructs a new `Remark` object with the supplied text and the current date. It then returns a `RemarkCommand` containing the parsed index and newly created remark.

When `RemarkCommand#execute` is called, the command first retrieves the currently filtered person list from the model. It checks whether the provided index is within bounds; if not, it throws a `CommandException` using `Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX`. Otherwise, it retrieves the target `Person` from the displayed list and adds the new remark to that person using `personToEdit.addRemark(remark)`. A success message is then returned to the user.

An important implementation detail is that the current version modifies the retrieved `Person` object directly by invoking `addRemark` on it. In other words, the command does not construct a replacement `Person` and does not call a model-level replacement method such as `setPerson(...)`. In the current implementation, the command adds the new `Remark` directly to the selected `Person` object using `addRemark(remark)`.

The parsing and execution flow can therefore be summarized as follows:
1. User enters a `remark` command with a student index and remark text.
2. `RemarkCommandParser` validates the format and creates a `Remark` with the current date.
3. A `RemarkCommand` is created with the parsed index and remark.
4. `RemarkCommand#execute` checks that the student index is valid.
5. The target student's remark list is updated by adding the new remark.
6. A success result is returned.

#### Design Considerations

Using a dedicated `Remark` object instead of a raw string makes the feature more extensible. Since each remark already stores both text and date, the design can be extended in future to support richer metadata such as author, category, or edit history without changing the overall remark-management structure. The storage layer already supports this object-based design through `JsonAdaptedRemark`.

### Feature: Unremark Command

#### Overview

The `unremark` command allows a teaching assistant to delete an existing remark from a specific student record. This is useful when a remark is no longer relevant, was added by mistake, or needs to be removed to keep the student’s record concise and up to date.

The command targets a student by their displayed index in the current person list, and then targets a specific remark belonging to that student by its remark index. The command word is `unremark`, and its expected format is:

`unremark INDEX r/REMARK_INDEX`

For example, `unremark 1 r/2` removes the second remark from the first student in the displayed list.

#### Unremark Representation

The `unremark` command operates on the same `Remark` representation described in the `remark` feature. Each `Person` maintains a list of `Remark` objects, and `unremark` removes one existing remark from that list based on its remark index.

#### Implementation

The `unremark` feature is implemented using the `UnremarkCommand` and `UnremarkCommandParser` classes. The parser tokenizes user input using the `r/` prefix, validates that both the student index and the remark index are present, parses both values as `Index` objects, and constructs an `UnremarkCommand` containing the parsed student index and remark index.

When `UnremarkCommand#execute` is called, the command first retrieves the currently filtered person list from the model. It checks whether the provided student index is within bounds; if not, it throws a `CommandException` using `Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX`. It then retrieves the target `Person` from the displayed list and checks whether the provided remark index is valid for that person’s remark list. If the remark index is out of bounds, the command throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_INVALID_REMARK_INDEX`. Otherwise, the command deletes the selected remark by calling `personToEdit.deleteRemark(remarkIndex)`, and returns a success message.

The execution flow can therefore be summarized as follows:
1. User enters an `unremark` command with a student index and a remark index.
2. `UnremarkCommandParser` validates the format and parses both indices.
3. An `UnremarkCommand` is created with the parsed student index and remark index.
4. `UnremarkCommand#execute` checks that the student index is valid.
5. The command checks that the remark index is valid for the selected student.
6. The specified remark is removed from the student’s remark list.
7. A success result is returned.

#### Design Considerations

Using a separate `unremark` command allows remark deletion to remain explicit and precise. Since a student may have multiple remarks, requiring both the student index and the remark index ensures that the command targets exactly one stored remark. This avoids ambiguity and keeps remark management consistent with the object-based remark representation used in the model and storage layers.

### Feature: View Command

#### Overview

Describe the purpose of the `view` command and what additional student information it allows users to inspect.

#### UI behaviour

Explain what the user sees when the command is executed, such as whether a separate window, popup, or detailed panel is shown, and what information is included in the display.

#### Implementation

Explain how the command identifies the target student, retrieves the required details and remarks from the model, and passes the data to the relevant UI component for display.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

TeachAssist is a standalone, local CLI application designed to streamline student data management for university teaching assistants through a high-speed, typing-based interface. The system focuses exclusively on the structured organization of student information and manual consultation logging, deliberately eschewing integration with external platforms like Canvas or cloud-based databases. To maintain its lightweight and specialized nature, TeachAssist does not include features for automated communication, calendar scheduling, or academic analytics; it does not compute grades, generate transcripts, or provide predictive student tracking. By prioritizing a command-line workflow over a traditional GUI, TeachAssist provides an efficient, distraction-free environment for TAs to manage high volumes of contacts and administrative records across multiple classes.

**Target user profile**:

TeachAssist is specifically optimized for a distinct niche of academic administrators. Our ideal user:
* Role: Full-time University Teaching Assistants (TAs) at NUS.
* Workload: Manages a significant volume of student contacts and consultation records across multiple classes and tutorial groups each semester.
* Platform Preference: Prefers a dedicated desktop environment over web-based tools.
* Technical Proficiency: Reasonably comfortable with Command Line Interface (CLI) applications and values the precision of text-based input.
* Performance: A fast typist who finds traditional Mouse/GUI interactions cumbersome and "slow" for repetitive data entry.

**Value proposition**: 
TeachAssist provides a high-speed, structured student management system that bridges the gap between disorganized spreadsheets and overly complex enterprise software. By utilizing a typing-based interface, it allows TAs to execute administrative tasks—such as updating student details or logging consultation notes—significantly faster than a typical mouse-driven application.

3. TeachAssist displays feedback summarising the active filter and the number of matching students.
4. Use case ends.


**Extensions :**

* 2a. A required parameter value is missing for one of the criteria (e.g., `crs/` with no course id).
    * 2a1. TeachAssist informs the user of the missing value and shows correct usage.
    * Use case ends.
* 2b. A provided criterion has an invalid format (e.g., malformed tutorial group `tg/@@@`).
    * 2b1. TeachAssist informs the user about the invalid format for that criterion.
    * Use case ends.
* 2c. A provided progress value is not one of the supported statuses.
    * 2c1. TeachAssist informs the user of valid progress values and rejects the filter.
    * Use case ends.
* 2d. The absence count (`abs/`) is not a non-negative integer.
    * 2d1. TeachAssist informs the user that absence must be a non-negative integer.
    * Use case ends.
* 2e. The combination of criteria is valid but yields no matches.
    * 2e1. TeachAssist displays an empty list and a message indicating that no students match the filter.
    * Use case ends.
* 2f. Multiple criteria are supplied.
    * 2f1. TeachAssist combines criteria using logical AND semantics and updates the list accordingly.
    * Use case ends.
* 2g. The user issues `filter` while another view or filter is active.
    * 2g1. TeachAssist replaces the currently displayed view with the new filtered results.
    * Use case ends.

**Use Case: UC15 – Find Students** <br>
**Actor:** User <br>
**MSS:**

1. User enters a `find` command with one or more keywords (e.g., parts of a name or student id).
2. TeachAssist searches the student records for matches and updates the displayed list to show matching students.
3. TeachAssist displays feedback indicating the number of students found and the search terms used.
4. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

* 2a. The `find` command contains illegal characters or is an empty query.
    * 2a1. TeachAssist informs the user of the correct syntax for the `find` command.
    * Use case ends.
* 2b. No students match the query.
    * 2b1. TeachAssist displays an empty list and a message such as "No students found for: <query>".
    * Use case ends.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance
    * The system should respond to user commands within 1 second under normal usage.

2. Portability
    * The system should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments supporting Java.
      
4. Data Persistence
    * Student records must be saved to persistent storage.
    * Data should remain available after the system is restarted

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</box>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. _{Fill in}_

    2. _{Fill in expected behaviour}_

2. Saving window preferences

    1. _{Fill in}_

    2. _{Fill in expected behaviour}_

3. Shutdown

    1. _{Fill in}_

    2. _{Fill in expected behaviour}_

### Help command (`help`) — manual tests

1. Open help via command

    1. Test case: Type `help` in the command box and press Enter.

    2. Expected: A help window or pane opens showing the list of supported commands and short usage examples.

2. Re-open / focus when already open

    1. Test case: With help open, type `help` again or press the help accelerator (F1).

    2. Expected: The help window/pane gains focus (no duplicate windows opened). If a separate window is used, it is brought to the front.

3. Accelerator / focus edge cases

    1. Test case: Press F1 while focus is in `CommandBox` or `ResultDisplay` (text input controls).

    2. Expected: Help opens or is focused despite text input controls consuming function keys (verify fallback event filter works).

4. Content correctness

    1. Test case: Inspect help content and verify the `find`, `filter`, `view`, and `help` entries match the documented usage and examples.

    2. Expected: Command words and sample usages are accurate and executable.

### Find command (`find`) — manual tests

1. Basic single-keyword search

    1. Test case: Enter `find Alice` where "Alice" exists in sample data.

    2. Expected: Displayed list shows students whose names contain a word starting with "Alice" (case-insensitive). Result count shown matches number of displayed rows.

2. Multiple-keyword search

    1. Test case: Enter `find Al Bob` where both keywords match different students.

    2. Expected: Displayed list contains students matching any of the keywords (OR across keywords). No duplicates; count is correct.

3. Case and prefix matching

    1. Test case: Enter `find ann` to match "Annabelle" and `find ANN`.

    2. Expected: Matching is case-insensitive and supports prefix matching as documented.

4. Empty or whitespace-only query

    1. Test case: Enter `find` with no keywords or only whitespace.

    2. Expected: Command rejected with a usage/error message; displayed list remains unchanged.

5. Illegal characters

    1. Test case: Enter `find @@@` or unusual punctuation.

    2. Expected: Behaviour consistent with documentation (either treated as literal keyword or rejected); error message clarifies allowed input if rejected.

6. Interaction with filters

    1. Test case: Apply a `filter` (e.g., `filter crs/CS2103T`), then `find Alice` where Alice is outside the filter.

    2. Expected: Document observed behaviour (whether `find` searches within filtered view or full dataset) and ensure it matches the Developer Guide's statement.

7. After mutations

    1. Test case: Add a student matching `find` keyword, then run `find`; delete a matching student and run `find` again.

    2. Expected: Results reflect current model state (add appears, deleted entries disappear).

### Filter command (`filter`) — manual tests

1. Single-criterion filters

    1. Test case: `filter crs/CS2103T` ; `filter tg/T01` ; `filter p/on_track` ; `filter abs/2`.

    2. Expected: Each command restricts the displayed list to students matching the given criterion; feedback shows the match count.

2. Multi-criterion filters (AND semantics)

    1. Test case: `filter crs/CS2103T tg/T01 p/on_track`.

    2. Expected: Displayed list contains only students satisfying all supplied criteria; removing a criterion expands the set.

3. Missing parameter values

    1. Test case: `filter crs/` or `filter abs/`

    2. Expected: Command rejected with a message indicating the missing value and correct usage. Displayed list unchanged.

4. Invalid formats

    1. Test case: `filter tg/@@@` or `filter abs/xyz` or `filter p/unsupported_status`.

    2. Expected: Rejected with a clear error message explaining valid formats/values.

5. Absence boundary checks

    1. Test case: `filter abs/0`, `filter abs/9999`, `filter abs/-1`.

    2. Expected: `abs/0` matches students with zero absences; very large numbers return empty set (or behave consistently); negative numbers are rejected.

6. No-match combinations

    1. Test case: Combine criteria that yield no results.

    2. Expected: Displayed list becomes empty and feedback indicates no matches.

7. Interaction with `list` and subsequent commands

    1. Test case: Apply a `filter`, then run `list`, then `filter` again.

    2. Expected: `list` resets the displayed view to all students; subsequent `filter` applies to the full dataset.

### Viewing student details / remarks

1. Viewing a student with valid input

    1. Test case: Ensure a student is visible in the current displayed list, then enter `view 1` (or the appropriate index) and press Enter.

    2. Expected: The detail pane displays the selected student's full information (name, student ID, course, tutorial group, email, tele), attendance summary and remark entries. All fields render correctly; long text wraps or scrolls.

2. Viewing a non-existent / out-of-range index

    1. Test case: Enter `view 9999` (index greater than displayed list size) or `view 0` if 0 is invalid.

    2. Expected: Command rejected with an "invalid index" or usage error message; detail pane remains unchanged.

3. Viewing after filtering

    1. Test case: Apply a `filter` that changes the displayed list, then `view 1` to view the first item in the filtered list.

    2. Expected: `view` uses the current filtered ordering and index; the pane shows the selected student from the filtered view.

4. View and delete interaction

    1. Test case: `view 1` to show a student's details, then delete that student (`delete 1` + confirm).

    2. Expected: After deletion, the detail pane is cleared or replaced by a placeholder message indicating no student is selected; the UI remains stable and does not throw exceptions.

5. Repeated view commands

    1. Test case: Call `view 1` multiple times in succession.

    2. Expected: Behaviour is idempotent; repeated calls simply refresh the same details without error.

6. Remarks-heavy student

    1. Test case: View a student with many or long remarks.

    2. Expected: Remarks list scrolls if needed; entries show timestamps and content correctly; no layout overflow.

3. Re-opening the view when it is already open

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1.Relax student name and find command keywords validation to support special characters. Currently, the name field accepts only alphanumeric characters and spaces; we plan to extend this to support names containing hyphens, apostrophes, and other common punctuation, such as “O’Connor” and “Smith-Jones.”

2.Extend find to support prefix-based search across additional fields such as student ID, email, and course, instead of names only.

3.Add support for multi-value filtering. Currently, each filter prefix accepts only a single value; we plan to extend this to allow multiple values under the same prefix in a single filter command.

4.Add support for more flexible absence filtering. Currently, absence filtering only supports values greater than or equal to a given threshold; we plan to extend this to support exact values, upper bounds, and ranges.
