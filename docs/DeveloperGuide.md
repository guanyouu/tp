## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface`) mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.


### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("edit 1 n/John")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit 1 n/John` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `EditCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `EditCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to edit a person's details).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `EditCommandParser`) which tokenizes the input using `ArgumentTokenizer` (with prefixes defined in CliSyntax) into `ArgumentMultimap`. `ParserValidators` then performs structural checks on the tokenized arguments (presence of required prefixed, rejecting unknown prefixes, and flagging blank values) and produces error messages via `ParserMessages`. `ParserUtil` is then used to validate and extract the individual field values, creating a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `EditCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the TeachAssist data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed', e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components, as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain and they should make sense on their own without depending on other components.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Unlike the original AB3 model, TeachAssist uses student-specific fields and records instead of tag-based contact classification. Each `Person` stores student-related fields such as `Name`, `CourseId`, `Email`, `StudentId`, `TGroup`, `Tele`, `WeekList`, `Progress`, and a list of `Remark` objects.

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TeachAssist data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* exposes functionality through the `Storage` interface, which extends both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* delegates JSON conversion of TeachAssist data to classes such as `JsonSerializableAddressBook`, `JsonAdaptedPerson`, and `JsonAdaptedRemark`.
* uses concrete storage classes `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonUserPrefsStorage`, which handle reading from and writing to files on disk.
* is implemented primarily by `StorageManager`, which coordinates `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonUserPrefsStorage` to provide a unified persistence interface.

TeachAssist data stored by the `Storage` component includes not only persons, but also additional persisted fields such as cancelled weeks, weekly attendance data, progress, and remarks.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Key Feature Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Feature: Filter Command

#### Overview
The filter command allows Teaching Assistants (TAs) to narrow down the displayed student list using one or more criteria. This is especially useful for managing large cohorts and identifying specific groups, such as students who are at-risk or frequently absent.
The command only affects the current view and does not modify any underlying student data.
The supported criteria are:
* Course ID (crs/)
* Tutorial Group (tg/)
* Progress Status (p/)
* Minimum Absence Count (abs/)
The expected format is:
filter [crs/COURSE_ID] [tg/TUTORIAL_GROUP] [p/PROGRESS_STATUS] [abs/MIN_ABSENCE_COUNT]
Example:
filter crs/CS2103T tg/T01 abs/3
This displays students in CS2103T T01 with at least 3 absences.
#### Filtering behavior
Multiple criteria are combined using logical AND
A student is shown only if they satisfy all provided filters
If no criteria are provided, the command is considered invalid
Matching rules:
Course ID and Tutorial Group → case-insensitive exact match
Progress Status → exact enum match
Absences → threshold match (>=)

#### Implementation
The filter feature is implemented using:
FilterCommand
FilterCommandParser
FilterMatchesPredicate
**Execution flow:**
1. FilterCommandParser parses input arguments and validates prefixes
2. Ensures at least one filtering criterion is present
3. Constructs a FilterMatchesPredicate with the provided conditions
4. FilterCommand#execute(Model model) is invoked by the LogicManager
5. Command calls model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)
6. The model updates the filtered list
7. UI automatically refreshes via its binding to the observable list
8. A CommandResult is returned showing the number of matched students

Predicate design
FilterMatchesPredicate implements Predicate<Person> and stores each criterion as an optional field.
The test(Person person) method evaluates:
Course and tutorial group matching
Progress status equality
Absence count threshold
A student passes the predicate only if all present criteria evaluate to true.

Design Considerations
Aspect: Combining multiple criteria
Current choice: Logical AND
Pros: Predictable; supports narrowing down results effectively
Cons: Cannot perform OR-based queries (e.g., Course A or Course B)
Alternative: Logical OR
Pros: Enables broader searches
Cons: Less useful for refinement; may return overly large result sets
Aspect: Representation of filtering logic
Current choice: Single predicate with optional fields
Pros: Simple and centralized logic; easy to debug
Cons: May become bulky as more criteria are added
Alternative: Predicate composition (e.g., chaining smaller predicates)
Pros: More modular and flexible
Cons: Adds complexity; harder to trace combined filtering behavior


### Feature: Delete Student

#### Overview

The `delete` command removes a student from TeachAssist.

Compared to the original AB3 implementation, TeachAssist extends this feature in two ways:

- It supports deleting a student either by displayed index or by exact student identity fields: `StudentId`, `CourseId`, and `TGroup`.
- It introduces a confirmation step before the deletion is carried out.

This is useful because student records are important and should not be removed accidentally, especially when a TA may be managing many students across multiple courses and tutorial groups.

#### Supported delete modes

TeachAssist supports the following delete modes:

- **Delete by displayed index**
  The user deletes a student using the index shown in the current displayed student list.
  Example: `delete 1`

- **Delete by exact student details**
  The user deletes a student by specifying the student’s `StudentId`, `CourseId`, and `TGroup`.
  Example: `delete id/A1234567X crs/CS2103T tg/T01`

For detail-based deletion, the match is performed against the **entire TeachAssist list**, rather than only the currently filtered list. This allows the user to delete a specific student directly even if that student is not currently visible in the displayed list.

#### Implementation

The `delete` feature is implemented primarily using `DeleteCommand`, `ConfirmedDeleteCommand`, and `LogicManager`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Relevant diagram:** Delete-related class structure.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

</box>

`DeleteCommandParser` only performs brief format-level validation. It determines whether the input is index-based or detail-based, checks that the required fields are present, and constructs a `DeleteCommand`. The main design focus of this feature is the confirmation workflow rather than the parsing behaviour.

When the user enters a `delete` command, the command is first parsed into a `DeleteCommand`. However, the student is **not deleted immediately**.

Instead, `LogicManager` handles deletion as a two-stage workflow:

1. the target student is first resolved by `DeleteCommand`
2. the actual deletion only happens after the user explicitly confirms with `yes`

More specifically, after `DeleteCommand` is parsed, `LogicManager` detects that the parsed command is a `DeleteCommand`. It then calls `DeleteCommand#getConfirmedCommand(model)` to obtain a `ConfirmedDeleteCommand` for the intended student. At the same time, it calls `DeleteCommand#getConfirmationMessage(model)` to obtain the confirmation message to show to the user.

The resulting `ConfirmedDeleteCommand` is then stored temporarily inside `LogicManager` as a pending confirmation command.

This means that after a valid `delete` command is entered:

- no deletion has happened yet
- TeachAssist is waiting for the user’s next input
- the pending deletion is represented by a stored `ConfirmedDeleteCommand`

If the user enters `yes`, `LogicManager` executes the stored `ConfirmedDeleteCommand`. `ConfirmedDeleteCommand#execute(Model)` then performs the actual deletion through `Model#deletePerson(Person)`.

If the user enters `no`, `LogicManager` clears the stored pending command and no deletion occurs.

If the user enters some other command instead, `LogicManager` also clears the pending command. In other words, the confirmation is only valid for the immediate follow-up response, and any other input cancels the pending deletion flow.

This design separates the delete process into two distinct responsibilities:

- `DeleteCommand` identifies which student the user intends to delete and prepares the confirmation step
- `ConfirmedDeleteCommand` performs the actual deletion only after explicit confirmation has been received

This keeps the destructive part of the operation isolated and ensures that a student is only removed after the user has clearly confirmed the action.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Relevant diagram:** Successful confirmation flow after the user enters `yes`.

</box>

#### Design considerations

A simpler design would have been to delete the student immediately after a valid `delete` command. However, this was rejected because deletion is irreversible at the command level and a user may accidentally target the wrong student, especially when working quickly with many similar records.

TeachAssist therefore requires an explicit confirmation step for `delete`.

This differs from `clear`, which does not require confirmation. The rationale is that `clear` is a deliberate bulk-action command whose purpose is already explicit from the command word itself, whereas `delete` is more prone to accidental misuse, such as deleting the wrong student by index or entering the wrong identity fields. Requiring confirmation for `delete` therefore improves safety where the risk of unintended removal is higher.

### Feature: Update Progress

#### Overview

The `updateprogress` command allows TAs to record a student's current academic or follow-up status in TeachAssist.

This helps TAs quickly identify which students are doing well, which students may need support, and which students require closer monitoring. By storing progress directly in each student record, TeachAssist makes it easier to keep track of follow-up priorities across multiple students.

#### Progress representation

TeachAssist represents progress using a `Progress` enum in the model.

The supported progress values are:
- `ON_TRACK`
- `NEEDS_ATTENTION`
- `AT_RISK`
- `NOT_SET`

`NOT_SET` is the default value and represents the absence of an explicitly assigned progress status. It is used internally in the model, and no progress label is shown in the UI when a student's progress is `NOT_SET`.
Using an enum ensures that only valid progress values can be stored, which simplifies validation and prevents inconsistent states.

#### Implementation

The `updateprogress` feature is implemented using `ProgressCommand`, `ProgressCommandParser`, the `Progress` enum, and the model's person update mechanism.

When the user enters an `updateprogress` command, `AddressBookParser` delegates parsing to `ProgressCommandParser`, which parses the target student index and the new progress value before constructing a `ProgressCommand`.

During execution, `ProgressCommand` retrieves the target student from the current filtered student list, creates an updated `Person` object with the new progress value, and replaces the original student in the model.

If the specified progress value is `NOT_SET`, the student's progress is effectively cleared.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The sequence diagram for command execution is similar to the general command execution flow shown in the [Logic component](#logic-component) section above.

</box>

### Feature: Mark Attendance

#### Overview

The `marka` command allows tutors to record or update a student’s attendance for a specific week. This feature enables per-week attendance tracking instead of aggregate counts, providing finer control over tutorial participation records.

Each student’s attendance is tracked weekly, allowing tutors to:
- Mark attendance as **attended (Y)**, **absent (A)**, or **not marked (N)**
- Prevent marking for cancelled weeks
- Avoid duplicate updates to the same attendance status
- Automatically respect course-level cancelled weeks

---

#### Attendance representation

Attendance is represented as a **structured list of weekly records**.

- Each `Person` contains a `WeekList`
- `WeekList` stores a fixed-size array of **13 `Week` objects**
- Each `Week` represents one tutorial session

Each `Week` contains:
- `weekNo` — week number
- `status` — current attendance state
- `prevStatus` — used for cancellation recovery

Attendance status is defined using an enum:
- `Y` → Attended
- `A` → Absent
- `N` → Not marked
- `C` → Cancelled

Cancelled weeks are derived from a **course–tutorial level cancelled week map** stored in the `Model`. When a week is cancelled, all students in the same `(CourseId, TGroup)` pair automatically inherit the cancelled state.

---

#### Implementation

The `marka` feature is implemented using `MarkAttendanceCommand` and `MarkAttendanceCommandParser`.

**Parsing phase:**
1. User input is tokenized using `ArgumentTokenizer`
2. Required prefixes (`wk/`, `s/`) are validated
3. Values are parsed into:
    - `Index` (student)
    - `Index` (week)
    - `Week.Status` (attendance state)

**Execution phase:**
1. The command retrieves the filtered student list from the `Model`
2. The target `Person` is identified using the provided index
3. The student’s `WeekList` is copied to preserve immutability
4. The specified week is validated:
    - Must be within range (1–13)
    - Must not be cancelled
5. The attendance status is updated via `WeekList`
6. A new `Person` object is created with the updated `WeekList`
7. The model replaces the old `Person` with the updated one

If an invalid operation occurs (e.g., duplicate status or cancelled week), a `CommandException` is thrown.

---

#### Sequence diagram

The following diagram shows how attendance input is parsed, validated, and applied to the target student.
<puml src="diagrams/MarkAttendanceSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" />


### Feature: Cancel Week

#### Overview

The `cancelw` command allows tutors to mark a specific tutorial week as cancelled for **all students belonging to a given course and tutorial group**. This is useful when a tutorial session is cancelled due to public holidays, instructor absence, or rescheduled lessons.

The command word is `cancelw`, and its expected format is:

`cancelw crs/COURSE_ID tg/TUTORIAL_GROUP wk/WEEK_NUMBER`

For example, `cancelw crs/CS2103T tg/T01 wk/5` cancels week 5 for all students in CS2103T T01.

---

#### Cancelled week representation

Cancelled weeks are stored at **course-tutorial level**, not per student.

The `Model` maintains:
- A mapping of `(CourseId, TGroup)` pairs
- Each entry stores cancelled week indices

When a week is cancelled:
- The week index is stored in the model
- All students in the matching `(CourseId, TGroup)` are updated
- Their `WeekList` marks the week as `C`
- Previous status is stored for recovery
  - however, when TeachAssist is closed you cannot recover the statuses, in cancelled week

---

#### Implementation

The `cancelw` feature is implemented using `CancelWeekCommand` and `CancelWeekCommandParser`.

Execution flow:
1. Parser validates `crs/`, `tg/`, and `wk/`
2. Command checks that `(CourseId, TGroup)` exists
3. Command validates week range
4. Model checks duplicate cancellation
5. `ModelManager.addCancelledWeek()` is called
6. Matching students' `WeekList` objects are updated
7. Cancelled week is stored in persistent map

If the week is already cancelled, a `CommandException` is thrown.

### Feature: Uncancel Week

#### Overview

The `uncancelw` command removes a previously cancelled week for a specific course and tutorial group. This restores the week’s attendance status for all affected students.

The command word is `uncancelw`, and its expected format is:

`uncancelw crs/COURSE_ID tg/TUTORIAL_GROUP wk/WEEK_NUMBER`

For example, `uncancelw crs/CS2103T tg/T01 wk/5` restores week 5.

---

#### Behaviour

When a cancelled week is restored:
- The week is removed from the cancelled week map
- All students in the `(CourseId, TGroup)` pair are updated
- Their `WeekList` restores the previous status
- UI reflects restored attendance values

---

#### Implementation

The `uncancelw` feature is implemented using `UnCancelWeekCommand` and `UnCancelWeekCommandParser`.

Execution flow:
1. Parser validates prefixes
2. Command checks course–tutorial existence
3. Command verifies week is currently cancelled
4. `ModelManager.removeCancelledWeek()` is called
5. Matching students are updated
6. Persistent map is updated

If the week is not currently cancelled, the command throws a `CommandException` indicating that the week is not cancelled.


### Feature: Remark Command
#### Overview

The `remark` command allows a teaching assistant to attach a remark to a specific student. This is useful for recording contextual observations that are not captured by the standard student fields (e.g, class participation, submission behaviour, consultation follow-ups, or other teaching-related comments)

The command targets a student by their displayed student index in the current person list and adds a remark to that student. The remark is intended to help TAs keep track of student-specific context across multiple interactions. The command word is `remark`, and its expected format is:

`remark INDEX txt/REMARK`

For example, `remark 1 txt/Participates actively in class` adds a new remark `Participates actively in class` to the first student in the displayed list.

#### Remark representation

In the model, a remark is represented as a dedicated `Remark` object rather than plain text alone. Each remark stores:
- the remark text
- the date on which the remark was created

This design allows each remark to carry basic metadata in addition to its content. In the current implementation, the creation date is automatically assigned using `LocalDate.now()` when the command is parsed. This means the user only provides the text of the remark, while the system records the date implicitly.

- Remarks are stored in each `Person` as a `List<Remark>`.
- In storage, `JsonAdaptedPerson` stores `remarks` as a `List<JsonAdaptedRemark>`.
- Each `JsonAdaptedRemark` contains a `text` field and a `date` field.
- During deserialization, each adapted remark is converted back into a model-level `Remark` object and reattached to the corresponding person.

#### Implementation

When `RemarkCommand#execute` is called, the command first retrieves the currently filtered person list from the model. It checks whether the provided index is within bounds; if not, it throws a `CommandException` using `Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX`. Otherwise, it retrieves the target `Person` from the displayed list, constructs a copy of that person, adds the new remark to the copied person, and updates the model using `model.setPerson(personToEdit, editedPerson)`. A success message is then returned to the user.

An important implementation detail is that the command does not mutate the original `Person` object in place. Instead, it works on a copied `Person` instance and replaces the old person in the model using `setPerson(...)`. This makes the update explicit and aligns the remark feature with the application's general update pattern.

The following sequence diagram provides a simplified view of how the updated address book state is persisted through the storage layer after execution of the `remark` command.

![Remark command sequence diagram](images/RemarkSequenceDiagram.png)


### Feature: View Command

#### Overview

The `view` command opens a dedicated panel on the right-hand side of the UI to display the full details of a single student. This provides a comprehensive, at-a-glance summary, including the student's attendance record and all associated remarks, which are not fully visible in the main list.

#### Implementation

The `view` command is implemented by `ViewCommand`, `ViewCommandParser`, and the `ViewWindow` UI component.

1.  **`ViewCommandParser`**: Parses the user input to extract the target student's index from the currently displayed list.
2.  **`ViewCommand`**: Retrieves the `Person` object from the `Model` at the specified index. It then returns a `CommandResult` with the `showView` flag set to `true` and a reference to the `Person` object to be viewed.
3.  **`MainWindow`**: Receives the `CommandResult` and calls `handleView(person)`. This method updates the `ViewWindow` with the student's data and displays it in the `viewWindowPlaceholder`.
4.  **`ViewWindow`**: A `UiPart` that contains FXML elements for displaying person details. Its `setPerson(Person person)` method populates the UI fields with the student's information, including dynamically generated cards for each remark.

#### View Window Auto-Sync

The `ViewWindow` has logic to automatically update or clear itself after any command is executed. This ensures the displayed details do not become stale. For example, if the user edits a student who is currently being viewed, the view should refresh. If the student is deleted or filtered out of the main list, the view should be cleared.

The activity diagram below illustrates this logic, which is primarily handled by the `updateViewWindowAfterCommand()` method in `MainWindow`.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

TeachAssist is a standalone, local CLI application designed to streamline student data management for university teaching assistants through a high-speed, typing-based interface. The system focuses exclusively on the structured organization of student information and manual consultation logging, deliberately eschewing integration with external platforms like Canvas or cloud-based databases. To maintain its lightweight and specialized nature, TeachAssist does not include features for automated communication, calendar scheduling, or academic analytics; it does not compute grades, generate transcripts, or provide predictive student tracking. By prioritizing a command-line workflow over a traditional GUI, TeachAssist provides an efficient, distraction-free environment for TAs to manage high volumes of contacts and administrative records across multiple classes.

**Target user profile**:

TeachAssist is specifically optimized for a distinct niche of academic administrators. Our ideal user:
* Role: Full-time University Teaching Assistants (TAs) at NUS.
* Workload: Manages a significant volume of student contacts and consultation records across multiple classes and tutorial groups each semester.
* Platform Preference: Prefers a dedicated desktop environment over web-based tools.
* Technical Proficiency: Reasonably comfortable with Command Line Interface (CLI) applications and values the precision of text-based input.
* Performance: A fast typist who finds traditional Mouse/GUI interactions cumbersome and "slow" for repetitive data entry.

**Value proposition**:
TeachAssist provides a high-speed, structured student management system that bridges the gap between disorganized spreadsheets and overly complex enterprise software. By utilizing a typing-based interface, it allows TAs to execute administrative tasks—such as updating student details or logging consultation notes—significantly faster than a typical mouse-driven application.

    1. **Test case:** `add n/John123 id/A0123456X e/johnd@u.nus.edu crs/CS2103T tg/T01`

    2. **Expected behaviour:** Command rejected with an error message indicating the name constraint (names should only contain alphabetical characters and spaces).

4. Adding a duplicate student

    1. **Test case:** Add a student that already exists in the list (same student ID, course, and tutorial group as an existing entry).

    2. **Expected behaviour:** Command rejected with error message: `"This person already exists in the address book"`.

### Editing a student

1. Editing a student with valid fields

    1. **Test case:** `edit 1 n/Jane Doe e/janed@u.nus.edu`

New progress: ON_TRACK"`. Note: progress values are case-insensitive (`ON_TRACK` and `on_track` both work).

2. Updating progress with an invalid status

    1. **Test case:** `updateprogress 1 p/GOOD`

    2. **Expected behaviour:** The command is rejected, no student record is updated, and an error message is shown: `"Invalid progress value. Allowed values are: on_track, needs_attention, at_risk, clear."`.

3. Updating progress with an invalid index

    1. **Test case:** `updateprogress 999 p/at_risk`

    2. **Expected behaviour:** If index `999` is outside the bounds of the current filtered list, the command is rejected, no student record is updated, and an error message is shown: `"The student index provided is invalid"`.

4. Removing progress using `clear` or `not_set`

    1. **Test case:** `updateprogress 1 p/clear` (or equivalently `updateprogress 1 p/not_set`)

    2. **Expected behaviour:** If index `1` refers to a valid student in the current filtered list, the student's progress is reset to `NOT_SET`. The progress tag is removed from the student card in the UI, and a success message is shown: `"Cleared progress for student: <student details>"`.

5. Updating progress with invalid command format

    1. **Test case:** `updateprogress p/on_track` (missing index)

    2. **Expected behaviour:** Command rejected with error message: `"Invalid week number. Valid range: 1 to 13."`.

4. Uncancelling non-existent course/tutorial

    1. **Test case:** `uncancelweek crs/CS9999 tg/T99 week/1`

    2. **Expected behaviour:** Command rejected with error message: `"Course CS9999 with tutorial T99 does not exist and cannot be uncancelled."`.

### Adding a remark

1. Adding a remark with valid input

    1. **Test case:** `remark 1 txt/Participates actively in class`

    2. **Expected behaviour:** A remark with the text "Participates actively in class" and the current date is added to the student at index 1. Success message shown: `"Added remark to Person: <student details> Remark: Participates actively in class"`.

2. Adding a remark with invalid input

    1. **Test case:** `remark 1 txt/` (empty remark text after prefix)

    2. **Expected behaviour:** Command rejected with error message: `"Remark text cannot be empty."`.

    3. **Test case:** `remark 1` (missing `txt/` prefix entirely)

    4. **Expected behaviour:** Command rejected with an error message showing the correct usage format.

3. Adding a remark to a non-existent student

    1. **Test case:** `remark 999 txt/Some remark` (where index 999 exceeds the displayed list size)

    2. **Expected behaviour:** Command rejected with error message: `"The student index provided is invalid"`.

### Viewing student details / remarks

1. Viewing a student with valid input

    1. **Test case:** Ensure a student is visible in the current displayed list, then enter `view 1` and press Enter.

    2. **Expected behaviour:** The detail pane displays the selected student's full information (name, student ID, course, tutorial group, email, tele), attendance summary and remark entries. Success message shown: `"Viewing student: <student details>"`. All fields render correctly; long text wraps or scrolls.

2. Viewing a non-existent / out-of-range index

    1. **Test case:** Enter `view 9999` (index greater than displayed list size) or `view 0`.

    2. **Expected behaviour:** Command rejected with error message: `"The student index provided is invalid"`; detail pane remains unchanged.


### Listing students

1. Listing all students

    1. **Test case:** First apply a filter (e.g., `filter crs/CS2103T`), then enter `list`.

    2. **Expected behaviour:** The full student list is displayed (all filters cleared), sorted alphabetically by name. Success message shown: `"Listed all persons"`.

### Clearing the student list / sample data

1. Clearing all students

    1. **Test case:** Ensure the list has at least one student, then enter `clear`.

    2. **Expected behaviour:** All student records are removed from TeachAssist. The list becomes empty. Success message shown: `"Address book has been cleared!"`.

2. Clearing when the list is already empty

    1. **Test case:** Enter `clear` when the student list is already empty (e.g., after a previous `clear`).

    2. **Expected behaviour:** The command succeeds with the same message: `"Address book has been cleared!"`. No error is shown.

### Clearing filters

Note: There is no dedicated `clearfilter` command. To reset any active filter and return to the full student list, use the `list` command.

1. Clearing an active filter

    1. **Test case:** First apply a filter (e.g., `filter crs/CS2103T`), verify the list is filtered, then enter `list`.

    2. **Expected behaviour:** The full student list is restored, sorted alphabetically by name. All filters are cleared. Success message shown: `"Listed all persons"`.

2. Clearing when no filter is active

    1. **Test case:** Without any active filter, enter `list`.

    2. **Expected behaviour:** The full student list is displayed (unchanged). Success message shown: `"Listed all persons"`. No error is shown.

### Saving data

1. Data persistence after normal usage

    1. **Test case:** Add a student (e.g., `add n/Test Student id/A9999999Z e/test@u.nus.edu crs/CS2103T tg/T01`), then close the app using `exit` and relaunch it.

    2. **Expected behaviour:** The newly added student appears in the list after relaunching. All data modifications (adds, edits, deletes) are persisted to `data/addressbook.json`.

2. Dealing with missing data files

    1. **Test case:** Close the app, delete the `data/addressbook.json` file, then relaunch the app.

    2. **Expected behaviour:** The app launches with the default sample data, as if running for the first time. A new `data/addressbook.json` file is created upon the next data-modifying command.

3. Dealing with corrupted data files

    1. **Test case:** Close the app, open `data/addressbook.json` in a text editor and corrupt it (e.g., delete a closing brace or add invalid characters), then relaunch the app.

    2. **Expected behaviour:** The app launches with an empty student list. The corrupted data file is not loaded. A warning may be logged.

### Suggested exploratory testing

1. Combining multiple commands in sequence

    1. **Workflow:** Add a student → mark their attendance for weeks 1–3 → update their progress to `at_risk` → add a remark → use `view` to verify all data → edit their email → use `view` again to confirm the edit is reflected → delete the student with confirmation. Verify each step produces the correct success message and the data is consistent throughout.

2. Testing invalid inputs and edge cases

    1. **Workflow:** Try each command with: empty arguments, extra spaces, very long input strings, special characters in fields, index `0`, negative indices, and indices exceeding the list size. Verify that all invalid inputs produce clear, specific error messages and do not corrupt the application state.

3. Testing persistence across restarts

    1. **Workflow:** Make several data changes (add students, mark attendance, update progress, add remarks), then close the app with `exit`. Relaunch and verify that all changes persist. Then close without `exit` (e.g., close the window) and verify data is still saved.


## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1.Relax student name and find command keywords validation to support special characters. Currently, the name field accepts only alphabetical characters and spaces; we plan to extend this to support names containing hyphens, apostrophes, and other common punctuation, such as “O’Connor” and “Smith-Jones.”

2.Extend find to support prefix-based search across additional fields such as student ID, email, and course, instead of names only.

3.Add support for multi-value filtering. Currently, each filter prefix accepts only a single value; we plan to extend this to allow multiple values under the same prefix in a single filter command.

4.Add support for more flexible absence filtering. Currently, absence filtering only supports values greater than or equal to a given threshold; we plan to extend this to support exact values, upper bounds, and ranges.

5. Add confirmation support for `clear`. Currently, `clear` removes all student records immediately after execution. We plan to introduce an optional confirmation workflow similar to `delete`, so that users must explicitly confirm before all records are removed. One possible implementation is to let `LogicManager` temporarily store a pending clear action after a valid `clear` command is entered, and only execute the actual clearing when the user responds with `yes`. Entering `no` or another command would cancel the pending clear action. This would reduce the risk of accidental mass deletion while keeping the command behaviour consistent with other destructive operations.
